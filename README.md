PandoraExtended is a chrome extension that allows users to use basic features of an opened Pandora tab without having to switch to the tab itself. You can, for example, 'like' a currently playing song without breaking away from your work, or skip a song while going through your email.

At the moment, the extension is only a service for controlling an opened Pandora tab. In the future, the objective is to include Pandora features without needing an opened tab. 

We are currently working on the ability to launch Pandora from the extension.
